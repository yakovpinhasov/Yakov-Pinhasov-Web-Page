 Part One - Git Commands Step By Step:
1) Create folder in my git bash terminal where my project will be saved and linked to git hub.
	- cd /c/users/jackob
	- mkdir global_w
2)Creat new repository on github.com
Type the commands on git bash terminal:
3)git init
4)git clone git@github.com:yakovpinhasov/Yakov-Pinhasov-Web-Page.git (the link from github for my repository)
5)git remote add origin git@github.com:yakovpinhasov/Yakov-Pinhasov-Web-Page.git
6) create files on the same directory in my pc: global_w.html and global_w.css
7)git status: to check the status of my files. If it gives me the message "modyfied.." it means that their are files that been modified but not yet pushed to the repository.
8)git add -A
9)git commit -m "description of the changes i commited to the files"
10)git push -u origin master. (if i am working with a group on the project and someone added files i will have to apply: git pull orgin master before the push command to pull all the files that my team added.
